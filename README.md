Breast Cancer Detection Model
This repository contains a breast cancer detection model built using TensorFlow, SMOTE for handling class imbalance, and SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) for model interpretation.

Overview
The model is designed to predict the diagnosis of breast cancer as malignant (M) or benign (B) based on various features. The dataset is preprocessed, and the class imbalance is addressed using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique). The architecture of the neural network is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API. After training the model, it is saved, and predictions are made on the test set. Model interpretability is enhanced using SHAP values.
